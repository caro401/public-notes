title: "The serial position effect means we pay more attention to the earlier and later parts of long lists"
---

When given a list of items come out people are most likely to remember the first and last few, not the middle ones. [[Primacy bias]] covers the first bit, and [[Recency bias]] the last bit. 

This can lead to us ignoring the middle bit of lists, or for example the middle participants in a set of user interviews. This is why you put most important directions at the far left or far right on the top navigation bar.
