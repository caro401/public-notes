Recency bias means we remember the last thing in a list more strongly. It is easiest to remember the last thing you heard, so you're most likely to remember things from the end of an interview, or what the last participant said.

Take detailed notes or recordings of the whole interview and refer back to these to help you remember all of the tasks and participants.
