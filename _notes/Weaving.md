I own an [Ashford rigid heddle loom](https://www.winghamwoolwork.co.uk/rigid-heddle-loom.html) in the 24inch/60cm size, and a DIY backstrap loom that I made from some rolling pins, a ruler and some cable ties.

## Techniques
 
- [[Clasped Weft Weaving]]

##  Projects

- [[Notebook Covers on a rigid heddle loom]]
- [[Tote bag from a long strip of cloth]]

## Tools

- [Seizenn band weaving pattern editor](https://www.raktres.net/seizenn/editor.html) and the [updated version](https://www.raktres.net/seizenn/) (which is a bit too complicated for me at the moment). These are great for designing cool striped warps for band weaving.

## Glossary

- [[Shed is the opening formed when warp threads are separated]]
- [[Pick is a single weft thread in a fabric]]

## Reference materials and general sources

- [VÃ¤vstuga](https://vavstuga.com) has a bunch of resources, mostly relating to Swedish weaving. This includes books and videos, as well as in person classes in America
