## [Everbook](https://everbookforever.com/)

Everbook is a system of making perpetual notebooks using plain paper, folded in half and used to create "bundles" of other bits of folded paper, collecting all the things you need in their own place without much upfront commitment. I like the idea of being able to move pages around, and that you can add structure as required, in a recursive fashion  - a thing can easily switch from being a page in a bundle to the cover of its own bundle. It feels a little like Bullet Journal "collections", but more flexible. 

The physicality of a leather cover  secured with an elastic to hold everything in place is really appealing. The idea of making a folder-like thing from a single piece of paper by taking a little paper from the back cover and folding it into a spine, which can then be labelled, is really satisfying. Keeping spare [templates](https://everbookforever.com/templates/) and blank pages stashed in the package is also great. Being able to spread everything out in front of you, see all of the things you have going on and physically move stuff around like index cards I think would work well for not losing track of what I have going on - I'm great at putting stuff in notebooks and forgetting it is there when I'm not actively flicking through the relevant pages.

It plays really nicely with GTD if you do that, see for example [this video about the GTD 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJFVVP3nl7U&). Having a separate "capture" bundle is great - an inbox that can take anything as it comes in or comes to your mind. The "clarify" process can be though of as taking things from your inbox to wherever else they need to go. You don't have to carry round the materials for projects that you aren't actively working on, either on pause or someday-maybe, but there's nothing stopping you collecting relevant materials and thoughts to keep for later. This reminds me somewhat of Refuse to Choose and getting project ideas out of your head, and I definitely have a lot of hairbrained ideas that my brain won't let go until I've engaged at least a bit with them.

I think this might fit nicely with my inability to stick with any system for much time, and the resulting guilt that comes with a half-finished notebook or diary with a bunch of missed pages. It seems like notebook structure and the templates used in the various sections can emerge and change as required. There's nothing between you and getting stuff down, and throwing out pages you messed up or no longer need is not a problem - not like tearing a page out of a bound notebook. Archiving things to a 'to-done' pile/folder is great for reminding you that you have actually done stuff, and can make longer-term reviews a bit easier to do. I'm terrible at remembering accomplishments, so this could be really useful for me.
