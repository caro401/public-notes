title: "Your product title is your first chance to sell your product and make a good impression"
---

A product title can make or break your sales numbers. A good title can catch the attention of your audience and make them intrigued. A bad title can mean they click away onto the next product.

A good title should be:

- Memorable: You want your buyers to tell their friends about your product and have your title be easy to remember when they search for it later.
- Informative: potential customers shouldn't have to do research to figure out what your book is about.
- Short: Shorter titles are more memorable. You can have a subtitle on your product cover to further clarify what your product provides and use important keywords.
- Easy to find: Includes a few keywords that you want to rank in search for. Easy to say and spell, so people can search for it and tell their friends.
- Unique: Do your research and make sure your title doesnâ€™t have too much competition with similar products.
- Shows buyers the results of buying your product: What will happen for the buyer's life if they purchase your book? What results will you provide for them? What is the transformation the buyer will go through?
