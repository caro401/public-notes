I like to look at component examples when I'm designing websites, because I'm not a designer. And I like to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) because it encourages me to be consistent and use sensible defaults, and there's loads of examples of it in use.

- I'd love to buy [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/) but can't justify the expense at the moment. I'd definitely learn a lot from it.
- [tailwind kit](https://www.tailwind-kit.com/)
- [flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) has some freely available components.
- [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/) is on top of Tailwind and writes its own classes, but some of the designs and theming ideas are useful
