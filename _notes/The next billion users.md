title: "The next billion users refers to the people who are about to become internet users"

---

The next billion users refers to the people who are about to become internet users, coming online for the first time. These users probably have different considerations to you:

- cost - people probably don't have high-end phones with big screens and lots of storage. They will load web pages slower, and often need to consider saving space
- connectivity - probably not constant, and limited or expensive. Make the offline experience as rich as the online one.
- digital literacy - people might not recognise design patterns or icons we take for granted -what does "swipe" mean? what even is a touchscreen? Keep things simple, provide video tutorials and clear in-app education
- general literacy - users might not be able to read, or need to switch languages for reading or typing. Universally understood icons can help.

You probably have design [[Bias|biases]], such as leaving lots of whitespace to make a document look less crowded, or defaulting to LtR languages, or using a western classical music note as the icon for music.
