## That I have made and really like

- [Peanut and sweet potato stew](https://www.makingthymeforhealth.com/one-pot-african-peanut-stew/)
- [Brownies!](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/best-ever-chocolate-brownies-recipe)
- [Kladdkaka](https://alvar.dev/blog/how-to-make-swedish-mud-cake) - also their website and [typeface](https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/madetype/made-dillan) is really pretty, and not a cookery website, so you get only a paragraph of words before a clear and simple recipe. I wish more recipes were like this

## That I should try out

- [Red curry quinoa](https://vegangela.com/2013/03/24/red-curry-quinoa/)
