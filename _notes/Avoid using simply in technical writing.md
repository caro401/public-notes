Eleanor Konik's [newsletter](https://www.obsidianroundup.org/dont-minimize-difficulty/) and working on some docs reminded me of  how much I hate being told that a thing I found really hard is "simple" or "easy".  And of course she summarizes it fantastically:

 > Don't minimise difficulty

The things people find simple vary so much based on lived experience, background knowledge and a whole host of other factors. Let readers decide whether that step in your docs was easy for them or not, rather than making them feel stupid when the thing you said was easy actually tripped them up for whatever reason.
