title: "12 startups in 12 months is a challenge started by Pieter Levels in 2014"
---

The original idea comes from [@levelsio](https://twitter.com/levelsio) , explained in this [original blog post](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/). He notes that people have problems with finishing things and launching things, and I definitely do. [Lots](https://monicalent.com/12x-startup/) [of](https://blog.yongfook.com/12-startups-in-12-months.html) [others](https://larskarbo.no/12-startups-12-months/) [have](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/category/blog/projects/the-levels-challenge-build-12-startups-in-12-months/) [tried](https://github.com/gamwe6/12-startups-in-12-months) this challenge, and most don't get all the way to 12, rather fizzle out or hit on something that actually works and run with that. 

I should do something like this, as a way to attempt to get over that fear, and impose some deadlines on myself, while accepting that I'm interested in a lot of things. Full-on startups might be a bit much, but small web projects or "micro-SaaS" should be doable. The constraint on myself is that people should be able to give me money for the thing.
