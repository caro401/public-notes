##  and some things I want to knit


### Big things

[Ogaden cardigan by Lisa Richardson on Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/ogaden) has a lovely stripe pattern and I like the contrast pockets. This is definitely a thing I would wear a lot. It needs quite a lot of yarn in several colours and some buttons though, so a dedicated shopping trip is required. 

[My Mood of the Day cardigan by Maruma Knits on Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/my-mood-of-the-day-cardigan) is another stripy cardigan with pockets. I really like the hidden pockets in this design, especially worked in a contrast yarn so they peek out, but I'm not quite sure about the bell-shaped sleeves. 

[Dance of the Needles cardigan by Meiju K-P on Knitty](https://knitty.com/ISSUEff20/PATTdance/PATTdance.php) is a solid colour front and sleeves, with a stunning lace panel in the back. I love the combination of plain and lace, as in the Jasseron jumper I made, and the interesting sideways construction. 

[Paulie cardigan by Isabell Kraemer on Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/paulie) has a really interesting neckline and collar shape, and a delicate contrast colour right at the very edge. People have made lots of different stripe patterns, and the stripes are often quite thin, so this may be a good way to use up small amounts of leftover yarn in making rainbow stripes.

[Vanora top by Susanna IC on Knitty](https://knitty.com/ISSUEss19/PATTvanora/PATTvanora.php) is a simple, versatile sleeveless top with a lace back and top piece, and plain front body. It is constructed as a massive rectangle, seamed up the sides and then a small amount of edging added, so is probably a very simple knit to create a useful garment. It will probably look best in a single colour, so I would need to buy yarn.

[Open road top by Amy Gunderson on Knitty](https://knitty.com/ISSUEw19/PATTopenroad/PATTopenroad.php) is a really interesting shape for a short-sleeved top, with some massive cables making up the sides, and a twisted necklie to give a standing up collar. There's a big cable pattern across most of the body too. This would be great for layering on top of a long-sleeved t-shirt for winter. Needs a fair amount of yarn in a single colour. 

### Medium things

[Weekend Cowl by Liz Capik on Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/weekend-cowl-4) is a really nicely-shaped neck-warmer, somewhat similar to the Purl Soho Bandana Cowl that I love so much, but a but more textured. Looks like it will be a great use of one ball of nice 4-ply, maybe some Drops Alpaca. 

[Intermingle socks on Knitty](https://knitty.com/ISSUEw18/PATTintermingle/PATTintermingle.php) have a very complex cable up the outside of the foot, as a contrast to the plain knit everywhere else on the sock. Looks like it will be a good balance of simple knitting and interesting pattern to keep my attention, but getting the sizing right might be a challenge. It is knit on 2.5mm needles, so will take a long time to finish.

[Calash scarf by Heidi Schultz on Knitty](https://knitty.com/ISSUEdf19/PATTcalash/PATTcalash.php) is a scarf with a pretty cable edge pattern, and a built-in hood! The cable keeps the scarf interesting, and I know that hooded scarves are things I like to wear, so this would be useful. It takes quite a lot of DK yarn, and really wants to be a single colour. 

These [fannrem socks](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/fannrem-sokker) with a plain body and a little colourwork pattern around the cuff - great for using up little scraps of leftover sock yarn in fun colours.

### Small things

[Colour block handwarmers from Purl Soho](https://www.purlsoho.com/create/2011/10/09/whits-knits-colorblock-hand-warmers/) are so simple, which makes them a great mindless knit for when I'm socialising, and look like they will showcase small amounts of pretty 4-ply yarn really well. And I always have cold hands, so more handwarmers are always useful.  [Wristies](https://littlecottonrabbits.typepad.co.uk/my_weblog/2012/11/wristies.html) is another similar option

[Bramble Basket Hanging Organiser by One Dog Woof](https://www.1dogwoof.com/bramble-hanging-basket-crochet-pattern/) is a horrible website full of adverts and pinterest links, but the pattern is a very versatile and useful crochet pouch, which can be made in basically any yarn weight, using up whatever I have left. These would make great gifts, or even gift wrapping for something small.

A bunch of headbands that don't use much yarn: [Ragi headband](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/ragi-hairband), [cats headband](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/headband-cats), [celtic knot headband](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/headband-celtic-knots), [smidge headband](https://h3dakota.com/2010/07/22/smidge-headband/), [summer band](http://amoangelus.blogspot.com/2014/07/summer-band.html?m=1)
