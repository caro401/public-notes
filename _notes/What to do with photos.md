I have a load of digital photos, which I have recently actually managed to wrangle into one place. But I basically never look at them, and most of them are rubbish. How can I make better use of them?

- Some kind of website thing?
  - [Stephen Wolfram's scrapbook](https://www.stephenwolfram.com/scrapbook/)
  - [Ga11ery](https://github.com/Heydon/ga11ery) 11ty static site, designed for webcomics but might be appropriate. worry about bandwidth costs for good quality photos though

## Management tools

- [digicam](https://www.digikam.org/) seems to be OSS version of lightroom? Big and powerful
- [allusion](https://allusion-app.github.io/) is a lot more lightweight, but basically no docs
- [eagle](https://eagle.cool/) looks like a vaguely consumer-oriented DAM, and is not horribly expensive, but probably for me this would be better for inspiration and/or the assets for each project, rather than my photo library. Doesn't support linux ðŸ˜ž
