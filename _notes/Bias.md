Having a bias means favouring or having prejudice against something based on limited information. We can't get rid of biases completely, but should work to be more aware of them.

There's lots of examples of biases and related cognitive distortions:

- [[Confirmation bias]]
- [[False consensus bias]]
- [[Recency bias]]
- [[Serial position effect]]
- [[Primacy bias]]
- [[Unconscious bias]]
- [[Sunk-cost fallacy]]
