- [Lottieknits](https://www.lottieknits.com) makes gorgeous hand-dyed yarn. They make particularly stunning gradients, I love the idea for their [Mini Fade Club](https://www.lottieknits.com/mini-fade-club) with tiny gradient skeins.
- [Jo Kalute](https://jokalute.com/projects) ([on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hellojokalute/) and [Spoonflower](https://www.spoonflower.com/profiles/jokalute)) does stunning surface pattern design. I discovered them through the [Craft Industry Alliance podcast](https://craftindustryalliance.org/powering-the-creative-economy-with-spoonflower/)
- Irregular Thoughts (on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/IrregularThoughts) and [Teemill](https://irregularthoughts.teemill.com)) make designs using Morse Code and binary, to put stealthy swears on things.

- [Ali Sharman](https://alisharman-weaver.co.uk/) makes woven things. I also love their logo, which looks like a weaving draft
