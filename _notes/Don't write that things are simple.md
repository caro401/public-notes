Saying that something is "simple" etc is rubbish if your user doesn't actually find it simple, can be really demotivating for them. Delete all those words from your text.

Add in missing context - you don't "just" do a thing, you do x preceding steps then the thing, and the user can then make the call for themselves whether those steps are easy.

You could set "simple", "just" etc to be flagged like badly-spelled words, or use a linter like [write-good](https://github.com/TravisTheTechie/vscode-write-good) for vscode
