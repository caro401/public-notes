This cowl has a really clever construction, using warp threads from the start of the piece as the weft for the final bit, giving a loop without any sewing. Using warp with different colours in gives a neat tartan-like effect on the front piece.

So far I've made two cowls from this pattern, one in dark green wool yarns including a bit of boucle yarn for texture, and one in teal and pink fluffy yarns.
