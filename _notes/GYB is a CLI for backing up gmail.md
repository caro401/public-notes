> Got Your Back (GYB) is a command line tool for backing up your Gmail messages to your computer using Gmail's API over HTTPS. <cite><a href="https://github.com/GAM-team/got-your-back">GYB on GitHub</a></cite>

It is pretty neat, although takes a bit of setting up to get through authorizing with Gmail/GCP.  Install is a cURL to bash job, so check the contents of the script before running it! 

I don't get tons of emails and I'm pretty rigorous about deleting junk, so my initial backup only took a few minutes and 5000 or so emails. I do have some important documentation that is pretty much only stored in Gmail, having a decent tool to back this up gives me a lot of peace of mind.
