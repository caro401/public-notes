Would like to try this out for making branded things for packaging for [Sheep's green](https://www.sheepsgreencrafts.co.uk)

- [Here's a big blog post](https://www.sat-su-ma.studio/blogs/tips-and-ideas-on-natural-dyeing/printing-with-natural-dyes) and they sell kits too. You need to mordant your fabric, then put dye on the fabric, iron it then leave it for a bit to cure.
- [here's another](https://www.suzannedekel.com/post/printing-with-natural-dyes) with some history, [and another](https://www.jennydean.co.uk/printing-and-painting-with-natural-dye-extracts/) with some beautiful examples
- [here's a book chapter](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-38545-3_1) which  I can probably find from the library if I need, and has some references I could chase.
- [this person writes lots about it](https://dancewithcolour.com/tag/natural-dye-printing/)
