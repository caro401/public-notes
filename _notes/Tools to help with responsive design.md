I've recently been seeing a bunch of tooling appearing that helps you view your website in a bunch of different screen sizes all at once. This is dead useful for making sure sites work at all sizes, and that they look consistent across the various devices users will use. You might want to tie the different sizes to the breakpoints you use in your design system, or to actual real devices.
