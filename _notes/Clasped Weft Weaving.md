This is a weft-faced technique, with a doubled [[Pick is a single weft thread in a fabric|pick]] - 2 strands in each pick so choose your yarn weights accordingly.

Work with one yarn on a shuttle, and one on the other side in a centre-pull ball. Pass the shuttle through, place the other yarn over your shuttle to catch it, then pass the shuttle back - don't change the [[Shed is the opening formed when warp threads are separated|shed]] and don't beat. Then, use the yarn on the shuttle to pull some of the other yarn into the shed - this can be random, precisely halfway or whatever you want. Then beat, change the shed and repeat.

Watch extra carefully on both edges that your edges aren't being drawn in.

I think this could be a nice way of using a small amount of really exciting yarn against a ground of something more plain. You could maybe use it for data visualisation, like for sun times or sleep tracking or something.
