title: About these notes
---

This is my space for sharing the random things I'm thinking about at any time. Everything is a work in progress, my own opinion, and subject to change. In general, assume I'm making notes on a topic I am learning about as a beginner, and that nothing stated here is necessarily true, just reflecting the best of my knowledge at the time.

These notes are in part an attempt to work on perfectionism, and force me to share sooner than I'm comfortable, so the writing is probably terrible. But I'm hopeful that the ideas and collections of sources and the like will be of use to someone somewhere on the internet at some point.

The content may well be incorrect - please [tell me](mailto:hi@caro.fyi) (constructively!) if so. I'm doing my best to cite sources, but I'm not an academic. Feel free to share and discuss the ideas, with attribution.
