title: "Todoist has an API"
---

Todoist has 2 APIs, a standard REST one for single calls and a special "sync" one for batching actions and syncing with the Todoist service. There's a Python library for both flavours, and a JS one for the REST API. and of course you can use [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) or anything else to make raw requests too.

[Sync docs](https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v8/#overview) and [python client library](https://pypi.org/project/todoist-python/) , but this is [no longer being updated](https://github.com/Doist/todoist-python)

[REST docs](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v1/#overview), [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/todoist-api-python/) and [Typescript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@doist/todoist-api-typescript)
